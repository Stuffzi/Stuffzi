Hi! I'm Stuffzi, or Makayla, depending on what you want to call me.
Primarily a C++ programmer but I'm versitile in many languages such as Java.
As a transgender girl, I go by she/her pronouns :3
Hopefully I will become a nuclear engineer someday! I write simulators on this topic and this is my fascination.
And yes, I'm a furry too!
